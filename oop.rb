# encapsulation
# bundle data and methods that operate on that data within one class

# abstraction
# hide complex implementation/logic details and only show what is necessary

# name = "Leon"
# puts name.class
# number = 10
# puts number.class

# class Car
#   # methods and logic
# end

# my_car = Car.new
# puts my_car.class


# attr_reader :name creates a getter method for @name.
# attr_writer :name creates a setter method for @name.
# attr_accessor :name creates both getter and setter methods.



# class Person
#   attr_accessor :name, :age

#   def initialize(name, age)
#     @name = name
#     @age = age
#   end
# end

# person = Person.new("Alanna", 23)
# puts person.name
# puts person.age
